## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Discord:
- In chat, hides anything extra
- Retains context when in nested windows through "preview" of chat to the side
- Easy to tell visually if muted, if audio input is being heard.

Notes:
- Quick insert of inserts like to do list notation, photos, etc
- Can be organized, "notebook" style
- Automatically does the boring stuff - day/time

Threads:
- Intutive horizontal photo scrolling without changing pages
- Preview who replied before clicking through - maybe the OP had an extra comment?

An app that I would like to build is a (in the future)social way to share your accomplishments for the day alongside a photo/video. This is not necessarily items on your to do list (which can be included), but any habits, intentional routines, etc. There would be a page for the items you'd like to accomplish, a page for your profile and your posts, and a way for you to make the post while connecting the photo/video to the task. In the future there could be a social home page including your own and others' posts, but for now it would be more of a daily journal to look back on.

## Notes

It's my first time making an iOS app! :D
